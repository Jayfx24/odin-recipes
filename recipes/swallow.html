    <h2 class="h2font">Description</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>I remember making a pot of (Okra) Okro soup with just two hundred and fifty Naira, (10 years ago üòÄ )‚Ä¶
            more like
            a one-dlilar soup.</p>

        <p>You can use frozen fish, Okra and some other ingredients to prepare the soup, then you could buy a good
            frozen
            fish with just forty or fifty Naira, I am talking about the ‚Äúgood lid days‚Äù.</p>

        <h3 class="h3font">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Sliced Okra (a medium-size bowl full)

        <ol>
            <li>
                Slice the okra and set it aside in a bowl. Remove center seeds from the shombo, combine with scotch
                bonnet
                and blend or pound using a mortar and pestle. Also, blend or grind the crayfish.
                I used just 1kg (2.2lb) of chicken and 500g of fish for this okra soup.

            <li>
                Wash the fish/chicken and season with a half teaspoon of salt, two seasoning cubes, a cup of water, and
                half
                a cup of sliced onions.
                Allow it to boil together for 10-15 minutes. Remove them while leaving the stock in the pot.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the stockfish to the boiling pot, one more cup of water, and cook for about 10 minutes till they are
                soft for consumption. Add two cups of water.
            </li>
            <li>
                Introduce 200ml of palm oil, add the crayfish, pepper/shombo, and salt to taste. Let it boil for 8
                minutes.
                Add the cooked chicken/fish and allow simmering for three more minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the sliced okra and stir, drop the cooked mackerel fish on top. Allow simmering for 3-4 minutes, and
                you
                are done with this delicious soup, you can serve okro with eba, fufu or pounded yam.
