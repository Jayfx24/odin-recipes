    <h2 class="h2font">Description</h2>
    <p>This pizza is quick, simple, and delicious. Instead of making the pizza dough from scratch, I decided to use naan
        bread for the pizza base. Using naan bread saves time and is also great for portion control. The only difference
        between this recipe and most pizza recipes is that it doesn't include tomato sauce on the base. I don't like the
        sogginess that comes from the sauce but feel free to try it with the sauce, as it will still yield good
        results..</p>
